                There is not any clearcut answer to this question. We can

                Social media has its pros and cons as other things have. In the
                past 10 years, our lives have changed to a great extent and we
                can say that our lifestyle is changing constantly. Social media
                is one of the greatest changes we have seen in past years.
                Nowadays we have several social media apps and websites
                available where people can connect with other people and
                exchange their thoughts, talk to each other, and can do a lot of
                stuff we will be talking about.

                Social media is also evolving and evolved very far from what it
                was in starting. Every social media has its own story on how it
                was started and for what purpose it was created. If we see look
                at the history of these social media apps then we will find that
                initially, these were very different from what they are today.

                We see different types of social media apps and websites that
                provide some kind of tool for the user to interact with other
                people on that platform. We can see social media sharing
                platforms like Instagram, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, etc. They
                all are kind of the same as well as we can say that they provide
                features differently from each other and that is the reason why
                they are surviving instead of having these so many apps.

                We see messaging apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal, WeChat,

                We have apps like YouTube which is a massive video-sharing
                platform in which people can share their content online on this
                platform publicly. Youtube is a platform where you have a large

                can live stream on youtube and this is a very useful feature for

                Recently in the past two years, we have seen many social media
                apps like TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, etc. in which
                you can share short videos of timing under 60 seconds. These
                apps are providing opportunities for people to showcase their
                talent if they have any. We can see a lot of clutter as well on
                these types of apps. People spend a lot of time on these apps.

                People are earning money from YouTube which is sufficient for
                them to carry their lives and they don’t need any job as well
                because they are earning even more than any job. It is a good

                Today we have a lot of messaging apps and they completely

                internet messaging which made the messaging easier and more
                interactive for the people who want to talk to their friends.
                Now we can share the images, videos, stickers, memes, etc. with
                our friends and family. We can message them any time even if
                they are online they can get the message when they will be
                online. These apps give us the feature of voice calls and video
                calls which is one of the nicest features of these apps and
                people are moving towards internet calling instead of normal
                calling. Another good feature of these apps is that they provide

                that you have opened an app for some important information but
                instead of doing that thing. There is a lot of clutter content
                on social media that creates a lot of negativity in your day.
                Some content posted on social media is inappropriate and
                unwanted for children and they are unprotected from that type of

                People on social media show the positive sides of their lives.
                People don’t post about the bad things in their lives and the
                consumers of this content think that the lives of celebrities
                are happy only and start expecting only good things in their
                lives. We observe a large amount of propaganda content on these
                apps and they target some communities and people. People do
                these things only for personal benefits and propagate wrongs
                things about anybody. We see people abusing celebrities and
                other people in these apps. We have seen many cases of social
                media trials on many people who are accused of something.

                The whole social media is divided into many sections and people
                are abusing each other from each side. It creates a sense of
                hatred against each other. We see that social media has become
                the home of rumours and many rumours have serious repercussions.
                Many incidents of mob lynching happened due to this social media
                and many people have suffered due to this.

                I would like to draw your attention to the garbage that this
                social media gives us and waste our time and energy. There is a
                famous saying that every rose has its thorns. So social media is
                a rose to express and a thorn that hurts.

                Social media has its pros and cons as other things have. It
                gives you some good things but a lot of bad things or we can say
                the things that are not relevant to your work and requirement.
                It motivates you in some way but derails you in another way too.
                You need to see both sides of a thing.

                Talking of advantages I would say that you can express yourself,
                make friends, connect to the world, know about different people,
                start and expand your business, etc. It allows you to make your
                point on every issue. It provides you with knowledge about
                nature, wildlife, lifestyle, culture, languages, etc. due to the
                availability of social media handles related to them. You also
                see the official accounts of all organizations that are making a
                difference in a good way. In addition to that, you find social
                media handles of many governmental organizations, sports
                organizations, business organizations, tech-related, etc.
                handles. It brings to you a positive vibe throughout the day.
                So, according to me, you should follow these handles.

                There also exists social media handles that create a ruckus,
                negativity, and disappointment in your mind. It may spoil your
                whole day. They try to influence and rage you against other
                groups of people. They provide no important information to you.
                They try to play with your psychology and disturb your mind. So,
                I recommend you to be away from such social media handles.

                You should follow those handles that give you positive energy.
                It’s your choice what you need. These all are my findings. More
                than 70% of people are wasting their time on social media and
                not investing it.
